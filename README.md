### Hi there 👋

I'm a FullStack Engineer based in London.

- ⚡ I'm not opinionated over Tech stacks, that being said : 
  - Vue over React
  - CSS over Tailwind
  - GraphQL over Rest
  - Pnpm over Yarn
  - Postgres over Mysql
  - Cloudflare Workers over AWS Lambda
  - Typescript over JavaScript
  - FP over OOP
  - Composition over inheritance
  - JavaScript over everything else
