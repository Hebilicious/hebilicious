  - Vue over React
  - CSS over Tailwind
  - GraphQL over Rest
  - Pnpm over npm over yarn
  - Bun over Deno over Node
  - Postgres over Mysql
  - Cloudflare Workers over AWS Lambda
  - Typescript over JavaScript
  - FP over OOP
  - Composition over inheritance
  - Android over iOS
  - Windows 11 over OSX
